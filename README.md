Gnome-Wallpaper-Changer
=======================

A script that changes the desktop background for Gnome.

All that is needed on your part is to edit the 'config' at the beginning of the script. 
There are some values already, feel free to change them. 

To run the script, once you've edited the config, simply type in terminal:
python3 wallpaper.py

If you would like to send the process to the background, simply add '&' at the end of the command.
Eg: python3 wallpaper.py&

This script was developed because I got bored of seeing the same wallpaper.

Execute the scipt at your own risk. I cannot take any responsibility for damages or loss caused by the script.
